# Walmart-Excel-Analysis

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varsharam/walmart-sales-dataset-of-45stores

This project was built around the question, "What patterns and trends can we find in the data that will help Walmart increase sales?"

The data includes 45 anonymous Walmart stores. 

My analysis looks at:

Fuel Price vs Weekly Sales,
Unemployment and Sales,
CPI and Weekly Sales,
Temperature vs Weekly Sales,
It also looks at the correlations in the data set

Conclusion: Noticeable trends in the data were increased sales during Qtr 2(Apr, May, Jun) and Qtr 4(Oct, Nov, Dec). There was little to no correlation with the factors I examined Fuel Price vs Weekly Sales,
Unemployment and Sales,
CPI and Weekly Sales, and
Temperature vs Weekly Sales.
